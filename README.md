Personal projects and selected coursework.   
See individual folder README files for more detail!

## gis_river_elevation_model
GIS project that analyzes USGS lidar raster data - Currently in progress 

## insights_from_supply_and_demand
Rideshare time series data analysis -- Currently in progress

## sales_data_analyis  
Small project that looks at time series sales data. Touches on some key areas of data analysis including:  
#### - Pandas Functions - For wranging data, resampling, and grouping
#### - Hypothesis Testing - Means testing with scipy.stats, p-value interpretation
#### - Data Visualization - Use of subplots and different visualization types to reveal insights


## VineClime  
This is a data science capstone project where I take a look at the California wine industry over the past 40 years, with a focus on the effects of climate change.   
It gathers wine production data from Kaggle, climate data from NASA, and tens of thousands of wine reviews from WineEnthusiast. 
This project identifies the most significantly changing climate features experienced by the California wine region and the counties whose production is most sensitive to these changes in terms of overall production volume and value. It factors these features into a time series model to forecast the wine production at the county level. The model is packaged in a convenient Streamlit webapp so the user can select which variables to plug in.   
The project also does an NLP (natural language processing) analysis on decades of wine review, and correlates flavor descriptors with weather features to see which climate features relate to the actual flavors consumers ascribe to wines.   
My intention was to provide insights to wine professionals across the board-- growers, producers, wine crafters, curators, and servers.   
    
All the data wrangling, EDA, and modeling was done with **Python**, making extensive use of the **Pandas** libray. **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** were used for most of the visualizations. **Statsmodels** and **sklearn** were used for some statistical analysis, and **Prophet** was used for the **time series forecasting**. 

## FCC_data_analysis  
A series of five projects for the Data Analysis with Python on freeCodeCamp. Projects were originally developed and unit tested on replit.
See README in the directory for details on each.

## Spotify_ETL  
A data engineering follow-along project from Karolina Sowinska's Youtube channel.
This is an ETL project in Python that gathers my Spotify listening history
using the Spotify API, picks out relevant bits of information, and stores them 
in a database.

## digital_photo_contact_sheet  
A pretty rigorous exercise using the PIL library in Python where I take
a PNG image, apply various filters to it, and make a 3x3 tiled contact
sheet showing the how the image with the different filters side by side.

## flight_booking
A simple SQL database project where I look at a flight booking
receipt and reverse-engineer a database schema that could be used
in automatically producing such a document. 

## movie_recs  
A Python app that makes use of a few APIs and takes movie title input
from the user to produce a list of recommended movies.

## wheel_of_fortune  
A text-based Wheel of Fortune game. Makes particular use of the class
and inheritance functionality of Python.
