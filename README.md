**Spotify_ETL**  
A data engineering follow-along project from Karolina Sowinska's Youtube channel.
This is an ETL project in Python that gathers my Spotify listening history
using the Spotify API, picks out relevant bits of information, and stores them 
in a database.

**digital_photo_contact_sheet**  
A pretty rigorous exercise using the PIL library in Python where I take
a PNG image, apply various filters to it, and make a 3x3 tiled contact
sheet showing the how the image with the different filters side by side.

**flight_booking**  
A simple SQL database project where I look at a flight booking
receipt and reverse-engineer a database schema that could be used
in automatically producing such a document. 

**movie_recs**  
A Python app that makes use of a few APIs and takes movie title input
from the user to produce a list of recommended movies.

**wheel_of_fortune**
