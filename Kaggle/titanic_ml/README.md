# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

Challenge: Use Titanic passenger data to try to predict who will survive and who will die.  
Score for this challenge is simple accuracy-- how many survivor statuses did you correctly predict in the test data?

The code is based on the official Kaggle walkthrough, but with my own commenting, digressions, and additions such as hypterparameter optimization.
