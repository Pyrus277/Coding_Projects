This was a course project from the Complete SQL Mastery course from Coding with Mosh.

The prompt was an airline flight booking receipt (see bottom of this document), and the problem was to design a database model that could be used to populate the fields of such a receipt (nothing more and nothing less!) and support an Online Transaction Processing System. 

The first step was to identify the entities and the relationship involved. To do this I drew up a conceptual model using draw.io. The next step was to flesh things out more in a logical model which defined the specific data types involved, and added a few more entity tables to normalize the data and avoid repetition. 

See the models here:

The third step was to implement the logical model into a physical one. For this, I went with MySQL and diagrammed the model there and had the software generate the SQL script to establish a database that would be ready to use. The transition into a physical model is where the primary and foreign keys are designated, the specifics of the data types and constraints are assigned, and a final review is made to ensure attributes are normalized, i.e. no data is needlessly repeated. A conscious choice was made to de-normalize city and state information listed in the airport entity, since these fields will conceivably always be paired, and to not introduce a new table. Similarly, the tickets table was set to have an auto-incremented primary key, as opposed to a composite key. This is to allow the option for a single customer to book multiple seats. These were practical choices made, but it could have been done differently. Of course, in a real world scenario, when in doubt about design choices like theseâ€“- ask the business!
