This code is a section-end project from the "Python Classes and Inhertitance" course from Python 3 Programming Specialization offered by the University of Michigan. 

The resulting program is a text-based Wheel of Fortune game. 

The first 90 lines are original code where I define the classes and associated functionality for players in general, and also define classes specifically for human players and computer players. More detail can be found in the comments in the code itself. The code after these class definitions was supplied as part of the project prompt, but a thorough understanding of it was necessary in order to write the logic of the different player classes, and be successful with the subsequent debugging.
